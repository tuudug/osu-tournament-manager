I'm ngl I have no idea what to call this project lmfao

Anyway, what I'm *trying* to do is basically a replacement for osu! tournament spreadsheets. 

So basic features would be
- Signups
- Mappool view
- Schedules view
- Teams/Players view

All these things should be able to be changed by the admin of the tournament, admins can set whether their tournament is public, private, or unlisted etc
